1. 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd rocky
[root@localhost ~]# passwd rocky
Changing password for user rocky.
New UNIX password:              # input any password you'd like to set
Retype new UNIX password:       # confirm
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

2. If you'd like to limit users to run [su] command, configure like follows.
On the example below, only users in [wheel] group can run [su] command.
[root@localhost ~]# usermod -aG wheel rocky
[root@localhost ~]# vi /etc/pam.d/su
#%PAM-1.0
auth            required        pam_env.so
auth            sufficient      pam_rootok.so
# Uncomment the following line to implicitly trust users in the "wheel" group.
#auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
# Uncomment the following line to require a user to be in the "wheel" group.
auth            required        pam_wheel.so use_uid
auth            substack        system-auth
auth            include         postlogin
account         sufficient      pam_succeed_if.so uid = 0 use_uid quiet
account         include         system-auth
password        include         system-auth
session         include         system-auth
session         include         postlogin
session         optional        pam_xauth.so


# verify settings with a user who is not in allowed group

3. If you'd like to remove a user accounts, Set like follows.
# remove a user [rocky] (only removed user account)
[root@localhost ~]# userdel rocky
# remove a user [rocky] (removed user account and his home directory both)
[root@localhost ~]# userdel -r rocky

Initial Settings : Firewall
 	
Configure Firewall and SELinux.
1. It's possible to display FireWall Service Status like follows. (enabled by default)
[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status firewalld

# stop service
[root@localhost ~]# systemctl stop firewalld

[root@localhost ~]# getenforce
Enforcing     # SELinux is enabled

[root@localhost ~]# vi /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
# change the value below
# enforcing  ⇒ enabled
# disabled   ⇒ disabled
# permissive ⇒ enabled but only logging, not deny accesses
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are proo
tected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted

# restart computer to apply setting
[root@localhost ~]# reboot

Initial Settings : Configure Services
# the list of services that are active now
[root@dlp ~]# systemctl -t service
64 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.

# list of all services
[root@dlp ~]# systemctl list-unit-files -t service


2. Stop and turn OFF auto-start setting for a service if you don'd need it. (it's [smartd] as an example below)
[root@dlp ~]# systemctl stop smartd
[root@dlp ~]# systemctl disable smartd


# Initial Settings : Update System
[1. For commands to updating System, it's possible to use [yum] or [dnf], so you may use [yum] or [dnf] as you like.
[root@dlp ~]# which yum

# Use Moduler Repository
[root@dlp ~]# dnf module list

# For installing available modules, Configure like follows.
# for example, display [PostgreSQL] modules
[root@dlp ~]# dnf module list postgresql

# install PostgreSQL 10
[root@dlp ~]# dnf module -y install postgresql:10
